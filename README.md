Powerball
=========

A program to perform some basic analysis on the Powerball numbers.
I'm in the process of rewriting a lot of the C++ program and writing a Java program.

For this initial release the C++ program assumes that it will run on a Linux OS with wget.

The program also uses SQLite, which is brought along.
